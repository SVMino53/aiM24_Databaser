/*

CREATE VIEW statement

In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of a SQL-statement.

A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table.
The fields in a view are fields from on or several proper tables in the database.

*/

/*

Views act as a layer of insulation between users and the underlying tables.
You can define a view that presents a specific subset of columns or joins data from multiple tables,
hiding the complexity from users who only need to see that specific data.

*/


/*

NOTE: Views are updated AUTOMATICALLY, as the underlying tables are updated.

Example below.

/*

Here are some specific scenarios where views might be a good choice:

	
	Customer Dashboards:
	A view could present a customer's order history,
	combining data from order and product tables.

	Sales Report:
	A view could pre-calculate sales figures for specific product categories

	User Roles:
	Views can restrict access to sensitive data by only showing specific columns or rows to users with different roles.

-- Okey, sidenote: let's try out our ON DELETE SET NULL

SELECT * FROM Literature.Authors;
SELECT * FROM Literature.Books;

DELETE FROM Literature.Authors WHERE AuthorID = 2; 

-- As promised, none of the rows from the Books table are deleted - their AuthorID is instead SET NULL.

SELECT * FROM Literature.Authors;
SELECT * FROM Literature.Books;


-- ALTER VIEW

ALTER VIEW Literature.BookAuthorDetails AS 

SELECT
	
	b.Title,
	a.FirstName,
	a.LastName,
	a.FirstName + ' ' + a.LastName AS 'FullName'
FROM
	Literature.Books b
	JOIN Literature.Authors a ON b.AuthorID = a.AuthorID; 


SELECT * FROM Literature.BookAuthorDetails;
